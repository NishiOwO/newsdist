1) What is NewsDist
======================

NewsDist is a simple cross-platform NNTP daemon, made for myself so I don't have
to configure INN.
NewsDist is aimed to support RFC 3977 "Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)".



2) Platform support
======================

NewsDist currently supports these platforms mainly:
  1) NetBSD
     Checked working on amd64 10.1.
  2) NetWare
     Checked working on 6.5 SP8.
  3) SCO UnixWare 7
     Checked working on 7 Definitive.
  4) Linux
     Checked working on Debian GNU/Linux 12 x86_64.

These platforms are supported, but not mainly:
  1) Windows NT
     x86    is checked working on NT4.0 SP6 (Terminal Server).
     x86_64 is checked working on Server 2012R2.



3) How to build
==================

Ways to build differ on platforms.

3.1) Building for Unix/Unix-likes
====================================

Requirements:
  1) C89 compiler, these are checked working:
     1) SCO OUDK
     2) GCC 2
  2) BSD Make/GNU Make
  3) Bourne shell
  4) Bison/Berkeley Yacc
     Note on SCO UnixWare 7: You have to build recent Berkeley Yacc to build
                             NewsDist, packaged Bison seems to be broken.
  5) Flex
     Note on SCO UnixWare 7: You have to build recent Flex to build NewsDist,
                             packaged Flex seems to be broken.

Simply run `./configure`, then `make`.

3.2) Building for NetWare
============================

Requirements:
  1) C89 compiler, these are checked working:
     1) Open Watcom 2.0
  2) BSD Make/GNU Make
  3) Bourne shell
  4) Bison/Berkeley Yacc
  5) Flex
  6) Novell NetWare SDK, or Novell CLib development kit

Note: CLib development kit must be located at /usr/novell/clib, or you must copy
      Config/netware and edit the `NOVELLNDK=` line, then run `./configure` with
      it.

Run `./configure Config/netware`, then `make`.

3.3) Building for Windows NT
===============================

Requirements:
  1) C89 compiler, these are checked working:
     1) Open Watcom 2.0 (for x86)
     2) Mingw-w64       (for both x86 and x86_64)
  2) BSD Make/GNU Make
  3) Bourne shell
  4) Bison/Berkeley Yacc
  5) Flex

Config file depends on the architecture, and the compiler. Use:
  1) `Config/win32` if you want to compile using Mingw-w64, and output x86
     executable.
  2) `Config/win32-watcom` if you want to compile using Open Watcom 2.0, and
     output x86 executable.
  3) `Config/win64` if you want to compile using Mingw-w64, and output x86_64
     executable.

Run `./configure [config path here]`, then `make`.
